BuiltDaily

Hi! My name is Wesley Tay. I am 21 years old and I am from Singapore. I created a fitness website called BuiltDaily to track a user's daily workout and nutritional intake, which was completed as of 20th April 2025.

I did it as a project with the purpose of challenging my programming skills and also making something that I could frequently come back to and use as I struggle to keep track of my workouts and daily nutrition. I wanted a website that could make workout, weight, and nutritional tracking to be convenient and hosted all in one place, along with a feature to monitor and visualise my progress.Hence, BuiltDaily was created. Through this project, I have incorporated Flask framework for greater exposure to full-stack development, Python, SQLite for databases, HTML, tailwindcss for styling the front end, JavaScript, and Chart.JS for data visualisation. Through working on this project, I gained hands-on experience not only with backend and frontend development but also in user experience, database design, and security practices.

To begin with, I’ve designed a clean and responsive login page, which serves as the entry point into the application. For the front-end design, I chose to use Tailwind CSS instead of Bootstrap. The reason for this was because Tailwind CSS gives me much more customizability and control over the frontend of the website. Secondly, it looks more aesthetically pleasing with a lot less effort compared to using Bootstrap CSS. In addition to a basic login page functionality, such as validating users' credentials through a database, I also added a forgot password button as well for the user to change his or her password in the event that he or she forgets. This not only improves user experience but also enhances the overall security of the platform. Upon clicking the “Forgot Password” button, the user is taken to a form where they can enter their registered email and update their password,d which will then be hashed and then stored in the database.

My register page acts as a simple registration page for the user to enter his or her username, email, and password. I have added a validity check in the event that the user has already registered under the same email address, which will prompt them that they have already registered an account on this website by checking for a unique email in my database. This was handled with a simple unique constraint on the email column in my SQLite database and appropriate error handling in the form logic.

My homepage acts as a dashboard to display key information of the user's profile. If the user is new, they will be directed to a profile page first, where they have to enter their particulars, including their weight, goal weight, height, age, and gender. Using this information, the website calculates their Basal Metabolism rate and their suggested daily calorie intake limit based on their desired weight. However, the user might want to have more control and flexibility over their calorie limit and protein intake. Hence, I also added a feature for them to manually key in their desired daily intake.

Which leads to my weight/goal tracker. It gives the user an option to update and track their current weight, and also update their goal weight if it were to change. They are also given the freedom of choosing their own daily caloric limit and desired protein intake. Users can also reconfigure their daily nutrition targets based on changing needs or lifestyle shifts. These inputs are stored in the database and can be updated as often as the user wants.

Next will be a workout tracker. Users can choose to log either strength training or cardio workouts. They can also enter the amount of calories burned during that workout session. The workouts are then recorded and reflected in a history table that displays all past workouts, making it easy for users to review and track their fitness activity over time. This also allows the user to hold themselves accountable and build discipline

Next is the nutrient tracker. This section displays the user’s current calorie and protein goals for the day. As the user logs meals or food items, the system automatically subtracts the total intake from the daily limit. Additionally, if the user has completed any workouts that day, the calories burned from exercise are added back to their “calories left” total, giving them a good sense of how much left or how much overshot for the day.

Lastly, I have added a dashboard using Chart.JS to create a bar graph and a line graph. The bar graph represents the user's daily intake of calories throughout the week. There is also a green line that represents the user's daily calorie limit. If they eat beyond that, the bar will turn red. Otherwise, it will remain blue. The line graph represents the user's progress to hit their desired weight. It tracks their weight over time and also adds a green line representing their desired weight goal, helping them see how close they are to achieving it. 

That sums up my final project. Altogether, it provides a comprehensive fitness tracking experience which helps the user set their profile particulars, their goals, track not only their workout and nutritional intake, but also their goals, and lastly, monitors their progress by providing an aesthetic dashboard for visualisation, all wrapped in a user-friendly, minimalistic and aesthetic interface. 



OP's Comments regarding the website:
Originally, I wanted to add a lot more features, such as a filter button for the graphs to track calories taken over the span of a month and a year, instead of just a week, in addition to a protein tracker as well. Similarly, for the weight tracker, I wanted to add a filter to visualise progress over a year or a week, and also to detect anomalies or weight gain. I had also intended to add an email verification feature using Gmail SMTP to add further security for registering and for changing passwords. However, due to time constraints (I only had 1 week to make it while juggling work and other school assignments), I did not have the time to fully polish the website. However, I will come back to this and revamp it. Hence, the version name is only "Version 1.0". My final goal for this website will be full scale deployment and converting it into an app, and publishing it on the App Store. Look forward to it! :)
